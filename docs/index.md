Welcome to FlexEdit! A lightweight program designed to help you easily and safely edit Flexible Survival savewords. Click on the 'Releases' button to get started! 

More information is in the README. The program does not have to be 'installed' to run. However you do need Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7. (If you are running Windows 10 Creators Update and above, you already have this.) If you do not have this, use the following link to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170

# [](#Description)Description
A few weeks ago I set out to create an editor to make 'save editing' simple and safe. Finally I've got something I feel like can be released, so here is the first public beta release of FlexEdit.

# [](#How_to_use)How to use
Simply click any of the 4 buttons to load a saveword for editing. You can either enter the saveword manually or simply point a path to your Flexible Survival folder and load all saveword files at the press of a button. 

Simply navigate using the tabs on the side to edit all aspects of the saveword. Raw edits directly edit game variables in the saveword, **please note that this is not recommended unless you are a developer that knows what you're doing. Changing values here can easily break story lines and result in you having to restart your story.**

Regardless of how you imported a saveword, you can choose to either export using the old copy & paste method, or directly write to the files **(! Please backup your files before doing this !)**
