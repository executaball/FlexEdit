More information is in the README. **The program does not have to be 'installed' to run. However you do need Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7** (If you are running Windows 10 Creators Update and above, you already have this.) **If you do not have this, use the following link** https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170

# [](#How_to_use)How to use
There are 2 ways to load a saveword.
'Load from Code' - You can load a saveword directly by pasting its parts into the prompt.
'Load from file' - Simply point to where your Flexible Survival gblorb file is (as well as .txsave files). FlexEdit will automatically extract the saveword information, with less chance of errors. 

There are 2 ways to export a saveword.
'Save to Code' - FlexEdit will export the saveword for you to copy and paste into Flexible Survival
'Save to file' - FlexEdit will override the '.txsave' files in your Flexible Survival directory. You will then have to perform 'recite txsave(1,2,3)' for all three saveword parts. This is a much easier and safer way to export savewords. **By default FlexEdit will create a txt backup alongside the txsave files it overrides, so there is no need to worry.**

Simply navigate using the tabs on the side to edit all aspects of the saveword. Raw edits directly edit game variables in the saveword, **please note that this is not recommended unless you are a developer that knows what you're doing. Changing values here can easily break story lines and result in you having to restart your story.**

Regardless of how you imported a saveword, you can choose to either export using the old copy & paste method, or directly write to the files **(! Please backup your files before doing this !)**
